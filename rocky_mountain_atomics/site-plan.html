      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>- Imagine what it would be like if you woke up tomorrow and there was no power in your house. What would that be like? Perhaps it would be only mildly inconvenient as you wait for the power company to fix the problem. Now, imagine what it would be like if you woke up and there was no power, anywhere. My point is, our entire modern day civilization requires electrical power not only to sustain our current lifestyles, but for survival. If energy is so important to us and future advancements as a species, don’t you think we should invest in that future with the best source of energy? Natural gas, solar, wind, coal… none of them are going to cut it and have already shown catastrophic failures in the recent past. Our mission is invest in the future of tomorrow, by researching, designing, and implementing nuclear technologies today.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience is anyone who would be willing to learn more about these technologies and invest in their funding. I would primarily focus on corporations and groups (colleges & universities, organizations, societies, etc) who would be willing to fund projects by helping them to see how they could each individually benefit from these technologies.</p>  <!-- change this -->

- The energy of tomorrow: The back-bone of our entire national power grid is natural gas. Due to the rising concerns of natural gas, many believe we need to go “all green”, but let’s face it… wind, solar, and hydro-electric power simply aren’t going to cut it. There is only one way to “go green” and still have a power source efficient enough to support and sustain a population of our size. Nuclear energy is the most efficient and sustainable means of creating electrical power that we currently have access to, and with a little more research and testing we could have it be even more so.
- Where could we go? : 
- —With nuclear energy at our disposal, the possibilities are limitless. Newfound research and testing has shown us the way to create “micro-reactors”, which could allow us to bring efficient and potent electrical power to every corner of the globe! Now, even previously inhabitable places can be made into beautiful civilizations. 
- —The rural alaskan debate. To illustrate our point, there has been a debate going for quite some time now. There are many rural Alaskan towns which require diesel fuel to maintain themselves, as all of their electrical power comes from diesel generators. The problem is, they live extremely far away from any oil refineries and it all needs to be flown in to them, which can be very hazardous. These “micro-reactors” could change every of their lives in very empowering ways. With just one single micro-reactor, they could have the potential of powering up thousands of homes! Add a few more, and before you know it you could power an entire city with clean and powerful energy. 
- With recent discoveries and continuing research in nuclear energies, we are finding ways to increase the lifespan of fuel and make them much more effective. With this fuel embedded in portable reactors, we have the means to conduct deep space exploration missions. Not only will we be able to explore the far reaching expansions of space, but we will be able to explore and set up colonies right here in our very own solar system!
- This energy could be used to mine on Mars, and drill for more fuel and water to sustain our systems set up there. The moon’s surface has been proven to contain a very potent type of material, critical in researching and developing something right out of science fiction: fusion reactors. (Read more)

- Technologies we develop:
- —Our institution has helped in the research and design for many of the most cutting edge nuclear technologies to date! We have consulted countless companies and governments all around the world in their endeavors to utilize this energy. Here are some of the projects we have been working on, and some insights to future ones down the road.
- ——Fusion Core Reactor (science fiction as of yet)
- ——Micro Reactor (These fission reactors are small enough to fit inside the trailer of a semi, and have the potential to power up thousands of homes all at once. With this technology we could bring power to every corner of the globe and beyond!)
- ——Isotope batteries (Cheap, efficient, and long (and we mean very long) lasting. Previous nuclear batteries have been able to run for 20 years straight without fail, and with our team they have only gotten better since! They are cheap to construct, and have endless practical purposes.)
- ——Longer lasting fuel cells (A previous concern for using nuclear energy is that the isotopes (the fuel) can only go so long before becoming depleted. So, we decided that we would double its lifespan. Thanks to the brilliant minds here at RMA, we have developed fuel cells that have a half-life that of double what it has been previously.
- ——Longer lasting fission reactors (Fission reactors need to be able to withstand extreme heat on a 24/7 basis. Another fear some may have when going nuclear is that these reactors will crack and break before we get much use out of them. A lesser concern, yet a legitimate one nonetheless, we have decided to aid with solving this issue as well. By infusing our reactor walls with grade A ceramic material, we have been able to greatly increase the strength and longevity of these reactors, making them safer, cleaner, and more efficient.)
